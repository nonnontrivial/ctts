If my observations are correct, according to the magnitude chart I used, I believe I can clearly see two, of a four star diamond-like shape that had formed overhead.   The names of the stars in the shape are: Altair, it was facing west (the right point from my view), And diagonally left and below that was Enif. And on eastern side of the diamond-like shape (not a part of it) I was able to see the star Maria. She seemed to glow brighter around the edges than Altair and Enif. She appeared to have a more defined, circular shape.

The faintest stars steadily visible were about magnitude 5.1 (that brightness is factoring in atmospheric extinction) and a star that was on the very edge of visibility (it popped in and out of sight) had a corrected magnitude of 5.5.

The next major constellation, as always, was Orion’s belt with Bettlejuice at the top of it. As I looked further into the darkness of the sky, I spotted Polaris standing out so bright with a magnitude of 2 against the pitch-black night.

I took several 30"" long exposure photographs of the sky, producing 3 'magic hour' type deep blue with stars images. Very clear results on all digital images of light sources in sky, 3 particularly clear, crisp, deep blue to black images. Gorgeous! Only wish there were fewer artificial lights so that the night sky would have been even more dramatic.  Would love to send in photos but not sure how or where to do that… really amazing night out tonight. Just discovered this site tonight for first time. LOVE IT! Thank you for what you are doing :-)","Several street lights in immediate area with no cowling around light. Much 'light spray'  Roughly a dozen porch lights on, various other outdoor lights.",United States - Louisiana
