Only a trained person with good eyesight would be needed to discern the Milky Way. Visual NELM estimated to be 4.3 to 4.5 based on star field counts in Ursa Minor and Pegasus. Andromeda Galaxy and Perseus Double Cluster was observed overhead, but averted vision was needed to see these objects. The stars of Orion and Pleiades were fairly visible in the eastern sky.","Cordorus State Park near Band Shell. Dry conditions, some dew. Area dotted by trees. Codorus State Park is a very suburban park with light domes along all horizon views. Eastern horizon appeared darkest. Horizon views likely impacted by Harrisburg to the North, York to the Northeast, Baltimore and Washington DC to the South, Hanover and Gettysburg to the West.  No outdoor dawn to dusk lights in immediate study area. Area illuminated by ambient light from surrounding cities/towns. Skyglow produced enough ambient light to where equipment could easily be discerned on the ground and field notebook markings could be read. Light domes extend 30 to 50 degrees above horizon - mostly in WNW from Hanover and Gettysburg. Tree lines at horizon level plainly visible. Hand placed at arms length in front of observer was plainly visible. Sky had a grayish-white appearance especially at the horizons and several degrees above.",United States - Pennsylvania

Sky is noticeably darker with very minor sky-glow to east-northeast and in southwest at tree-top level. Visual NELM estimated to be ~5 based on the seven main stars that make up Ursa Minor. All 7 stars were visible to the unaided eye and and/or with averted vision.,"Dam area of Doubling Gap Lake. Lat: 40.282987, Long: -77.414700.   Utility building on east end of dam has a single light pole (Lat: 40.282920, -77.414163) owned by power company. Bulb appears to be low pressure sodium. Fixture is not full cutoff and contains an unshielded glass fixture. Light does spill onto the dam area and illuminates trees across lake (visible in long exposure photography) and casts shadows on dam area. Utility light is probably more noticeable when the foliage has fallen from the trees. During the summer months the tree foliage may shield the light more-so than at other times. Otherwise area is dark with some light glow to the south-southeast, perhaps from Carlise. Mountain ridge tree line easily around entire area. Tree tops extend up to approximately 15 to 20+ degrees - higher in south due to trees being in close proximity. Hand placed at arm's length in front of observer was plainly visible.",United States - Pennsylvania

Although Kings Gap is elevated above the surrounding communities some light infiltrates the area especially from Carlisle to the north-northeast and to the west. The surrounding trees help to eliminate some of the glow allowing an appreciably dark sky to be viewed overhead - which allows some structure to be seen in the Milky Way.  However the trees also limit visibility of objects near the horizon.","Small grassy area across road and southeast of Mansion   (Lat: 40.093233, Long: -77.267726).

Climbed on roof to make observations. Was above street lights ( 3 total, 2 behind, 1 in front) and not a lot of glow in the sky. No trees or other objects obstructed my view of the sky from the roof.   In this Activity, I was looking forward to learning how to identify a certain constellation, in this case, the constellation of Orion. From my roof, Orion was surprisingly easy to locate. The clear sky was perfect for observing. I visited this website before going on the roof, and I was able to gain an idea of what exactly I was looking for. The 3 stars that make up ""Orion's Belt"" were not too hard to find. After finding those, I looked for  Betelgeuse, located above the belt, and found it. The reddish tint of Betelgeuse was very clear, and that aided in the process of confirming I was looking at the correct constellation. I would like to go out on a spate night, from a different location, and compare my results.",United States - Colorado
