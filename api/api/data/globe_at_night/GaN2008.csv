It was better than on some nights when the ball park (local city field) lights up the sky.  With 15x70 binoculars the sky was a treat.

I guess that is outside of this study but it still provides a treat even with Magnitude 4 skies.,For this area it was pretty good viewing. The seeing was OK but not spectacular.
