Other than the large light dome in the western sky, all other light domes are very minor and subtle extending no more than 7 to 10 degrees above the horizon. Light dome to the West and NNW extends 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon and is likely due to the cities of Hollidaysburg and Altoona. Other lights were observed to the north and east - likely from park cabins, maintenance buildings as well as boat launch and residences as seen across the lake.","Open Grassy Area between parking lots 3 and 4 in day use area.

Light domes are very minor and subtle as seen to the ESE (Lewistown) and to NNW (State College) just above the tree tops approximately 15 degrees above the horizon. The trees and ridges do keep lights from surrounding communities from protruding onto the area. Some outdoor walk-way lights was noted from the park office. Some car lights were noted from passing cars traveling on Route 305 (Greenwood Road). It is not known if the Blacksmith Shop parking lot lights are continuously on during seasonal hours. They were off during the survey. Treetops and ridgelines could be seen as silhouettes. Objects/obstacles on ground could only be slightly discerned. Otherwise area is appreciably dark.

Trees extend upwards to 25° above the horizon to the east and upwards to 10° to the west. Restroom facility has a dim outside light. Maintenance facility has a security light.

During active season more light from campers would likely be noted.     Sky is semi-dark with bright light domes to the NNW, NNE, and SSE - most likely created by York, Harrisburg, and Mechanicsburg.

Light domes were visible along all horizons except to the south and southwest where the sky appeared darkest. Light domes extended above the trees and ridges 10 to 20 degrees. The light dome to the west was likely due to the city of Johnstown. Light domes extending from the northwest to the north and northeast were likely the result of the towns Ebensburg, Munster, Cresson and then Hollidaysburg/Altoona. A light dome to the southeast may be the result of Breezewood, but it does not extend more than 10 degrees above the horizon. The largest impact was to the east where the light dome from Blue Knob Ski Resort extended upwards to 60+ degrees. It is believed snow-making was in progress - any lights illuminating the area would have reflected off of the snow making the sky appear much brighter. Skies were very transparent. Some structure in the Milky Way was still evident to the northwest and faded just above the tree tops.","Rural location.

Light dome extended above southern ridge from the far eastern and western extents with the strongest concentration to the southeast 5 to 10 degrees above ridgetop or 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon.

There is some headlight influence as traffic approaches the park from Stumpy Lane or travels along Aughwick Road. Darkest areas are to the west and north.

The sky was not completely filled with clouds but they were still present which also hindered visibility. However, we were able to see a good amount of stars. We saw one star which was significantly brighter than the others. We also were able to see a few other groups of stars which we believed to be the big and little dipper. On the other hand, we were unable to see Orion's belt most likely because it was not dark enough out.","The location is urban because there are many street lights, porch lights, and businesses lit up at night.",United States - Delaware

I could, however,  clearly see a few stars in Orion's belt with magnitudes of 1 or 2. They were bright and stood out despite the presence of clouds. There was contrast between light and dark in the sky as well. Three of the stars were in a slight pattern; they were in a row. I think that due to the many  clouds I was not able to see any color in the sky or symmetry in  patterns of stars. I believe the faintest star I could see was in the 3rd magnitude. This was not a great night to look at the sky. I’m sure on a clearer night I would be able to see far more faint stars.",,United States - Delaware

The moon was bright tonight and the air was not completely clear, which made the magnitude higher than we think it normally would be, about a 3 or a 4. I was also able to spot the Big and Little Dippers, two constellations that were fairly easy to locate from the field. Usually the two are very clear, but just like Orion the magnitude was a 3 or a 4. Those were the only three constellations I was able to definitively locate, even with the help of a star map. I feel fortunate to live in an area where we have the opportunity to see stars in a close vicinity because all of these famous constellations are even more fascinating when you can see them yourself.

I feel the clean Colorado air made it an even better experience because there is low amounts of pollution, as well as slightly less atmosphere due to the higher elevation in this area.  For the first time in my life I was able to see the Milky Way galaxy overhead.  During the hour I spent there, I gazed across the entire horizon.  It was nice that the moon was still not in sight to keep even more light off of the stars in the sky.  This experience made me excited and motivated to do this again.","For my dark sky observation, I hopped in a car with some buddies and headed up Flagstaff Road.  Very little light pollution is found up here.  Many trees were in the area but none obstructed my view of the stars.  No obvious man made structures in the vicinity. A small pond was nearby that I was only able to notice while the car headlights were on.  Small traces of snow remained on the ground in a few areas.",United States - Colorado

I was not able to report any clouds or haze in the sky. I spotted the 15° wide soft glow of the Gegenschein without even looking for it while it was only 40° up in between the Sickle of Leo and M44 in Cancer. I believe I might have just caught a glimpse of a magnitude +6.9 star below Betelgeuse, but can’t be certain because of how distractingly bright Betelgeuse was. However, I have proven that on the best nights, I can see stars as faint as magnitude +7.0 overhead. I’ve also proven that the galaxy M81 in Ursa Major is visible with the naked eye on those aforementioned nights. I like to say that I live under high quality Bortle Class 3 skies.","As for other aspects of my observing sight, I live out in the rural where the nearest yard lights are a half mile to my N, NW, and N. From where I observe I am only 15 feet from my house and have about 40° of my western horizon blocked by it and nearby trees. I also have forests covering a chunk of the horizon from the N to the E and all the way S (though the trees come nearest to me in the NE and SE). This is actually a good thing though, since as the nearest cities are in those directions (NNE, E, SE), the worst of their light pollution is blocked from my eyes. The biggest nearby city and thus my worst light-pollution dome is the one 21 miles to the SSE. It’s a noticeable nuisance because there is some good stuff to the south. The darkest and clearest horizon for me is actually in a part of the sky I rarely view – the NW!",United States - Arkansas
