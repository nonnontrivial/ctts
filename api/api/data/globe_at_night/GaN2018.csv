Había una ligera bruma en el ambiente debida a la humedad por la proximidad del mar que no impedía la visibilidad de los objetos, pero sí ayudaba a dispersar la luz de las farolas.    La Luna y Venus ya se habían puesto tras las montañas a la hora de la medida de oscuridad del cielo.    Las cúpulas lumínicas eran muy visibles hacia el Oeste (Adra), Norte (otras pedanías de Adra, Berja) y Este (Campo de Dalías, El Ejido, Roquetas de Mar, Almería...).     Las cercanas luces de Adra, muy deslumbrantes, impedían la adaptación completa a la oscuridad y su resplandor llegaba a superar el cénit. Había mezcla de luces de vapor de sodio a alta presión (anaranjadas) con otras claramente más blancas y azuladas (halógenas, LED). Muy mal apantalladas todas ellas (deslumbramiento, iluminación de la costa) y de intensidad excesiva (sobreiluminación).    Las luces de El Ejido llegaban al menos a 45º sobre el horizonte.     Eran apreciables diferencias de color en las cúpulas lumínicas de distintas poblaciones. Éstas afectaban mucho a la visión de la Vía Láctea. Únicamente se distinguía algo la zona de Sagitario. Sólo se pudo observar razonablemente bien bastante más avanzada la noche, cuando ganó suficiente altura sobre el horizonte.    Se notaba una gran diferencia al mirar hacia el horizonte Sur (mar), al no provenir luz del mismo.","Playa del Censo, al final del paseo marítimo de Adra, sobre la playa, justo delante del último espigón. Límite de la zona urbana.    El ayuntamiento apagó las luces de los últimos 500 metros del paseo para la actividad (observación con el alumnado y las familias del CEIP San Fernando, algo menos de unas 200 personas en total), con lo que la lectura y la observación fueron mejores de las habituales en ese lugar.

My name is Saujan Poudel and i am involved in amateur astronomy since i was thirteen. In my years long experience of observing, i  mostly observed from my house (The reported location) and never found any other location perfect for my observation. My house lies in a small village near densely populated market area, moderately light polluted area with a little sky glow. Even though my house is not free from light pollution in early evening but once it gets really dark and everybody is asleep, my house becomes a perfect dark sky site. Tall trees and houses helps to block light trespass from nearby dense area. My house area lacks the facility of streetlamps so, it is perfect for stargazing on a clear, dark and moonless night.",Nepal
