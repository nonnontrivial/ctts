They are being given almost free unlimited electricity.  Its created a huge light dome ruining this dark sky area for everyone and all the kids who came with their parents to observe through telescopes and binoculars or eyes. They are closed at night but run the lights all night washing out the Milky Way and all the stars. We can no longer image.  They refuse to cooperate at all. Their is no other place for us to go.  We were here first and use to be out almost every night of the year with our mostly clear weather. They ruined astronomy for all the children in the area as well as many adults.  These oil boom companies are ruining this for everyone and their money allows them power to do anything.,Out in the country where its very dark. Until 2012-2013 when Enterprise oil trucking and Louisiana crane company had a high pressure developer pressure a rancher to sell all his property so they could turn it into an industrial area with huge white caliche parking lots with bright football stadium lighting improperly installed with no shields causing a huge light dome that can be seen from space.
