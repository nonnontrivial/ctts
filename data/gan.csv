The clouds were moving fairly quick though as the winds picked up in the evening and maintained till now as I am writing this down around 10:30 P.M.   The stars I can see though are very bright, especially compared to the city I just left. The sky here has more of a blue tint to it at night and it might be the most quiet place I've ever encountered. One of the highlights of the evening earlier was the sunset as I swear it had every shade of red, orange, purple, and yellow in it. This makes me very excited for a clear night here as I know the stars will everywhere.","This is my second night in Pullman as I just moved here from Tacoma. First off there is very little light pollution here as it's a small town with little to no light other than street lights and car lights driving in the distance. Today it's overcast but still warm, around 70 degrees. The sky is vast and open here as I can see for miles in any direction from the hill I live on.

The light from the stars are bright, not full moon bright but enough to generate small shadows. I think I saw a satellite as I saw something moving on what seemed like a set trajectory which was cool. Really was hoping it was a UFO but I don't think I'm mentally prepared for that close of an encounter.","Same location comments as before, day is much clearer though.

Enterprise oil trucking and Louisiana crane both put in huge white caliche parking lots with unshielded football stadium lights that point horizontal instead of down. They are being given almost free unlimited electricity.  Its created a huge light dome ruining this dark sky area for everyone and all the kids who came with their parents to observe through telescopes and binoculars or eyes. They are closed at night but run the lights all night washing out the Milky Way and all the stars. We can no longer image.  They refuse to cooperate at all. Their is no other place for us to go.  We were here first and use to be out almost every night of the year with our mostly clear weather. They ruined astronomy for all the children in the area as well as many adults.  These oil boom companies are ruining this for everyone and their money allows them power to do anything.,Out in the country where its very dark. Until 2012-2013 when Enterprise oil trucking and Louisiana crane company had a high pressure developer pressure a rancher to sell all his property so they could turn it into an industrial area with huge white caliche parking lots with bright football stadium lighting improperly installed with no shields causing a huge light dome that can be seen from space.
