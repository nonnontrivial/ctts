# scripts

The scripts in this directory can be used to generate the training data and train the sky
brightness model -- saving the parameters in a state dict for use during inference (api).

1. `unpack.py` unpacks zip containing sky brightness dataset into the path that the prepare script looks for it.
2. `prepare.py` prepares the training data by combining source data into a single dataframe and writing it to csv.
3. `train.py` trains the model on the dataframe generated by prepare script and stores resulting weights in a state dict.

```sh
# e.g. using https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation
uv run unpack.py
```
