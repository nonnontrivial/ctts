# scripts

```sh
# e.g.
uv run unpack.py
```

- `unpack.py` unpacks zip containing sky brightness dataset into the path that the prepare script looks for it.
- `prepare.py` prepares the training data by combining source data into a single dataframe and writing it to csv.
- `train.py` trains the model on the dataframe generated by prepare script and stores resulting weights in a state dict.
- `consume.py` consumes data from the brightness queue and prints it to stdout
