# scripts

> n.b. these scripts use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies)

```sh
# e.g.
uv run unpack.py
```

- `stubgen.py` generate gRPC stubs
- `verify.py` call brightness endpoint against given lat and lon
- `unpack.py` unpacks zip containing sky brightness dataset into the path that the prepare script looks for it.
- `prepare.py` prepares the training data by combining source data into a single dataframe and writing it to csv.
- `train.py` trains the model on the dataframe generated by prepare script and stores resulting weights in a state dict.
